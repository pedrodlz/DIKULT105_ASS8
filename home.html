				<h2>What is upcycling?</h2>
				<p>Upcycling is the practice of creating a useable product from waste or
				unwanted items. In addition to transforming old materials into useable
				objects, you can breathe a new lease of life into well used and loved items
				to give them a new story and personality. All this while at the same time
				creating something that is useful, functional and beautiful.</p>

				<h2>Recycle vs. upcycle?</h2>
				<p>Recycling is the process of taking waste, generally consumer materials –
				plastic, paper, metal or glass – breaking it down and turning it into a
				reusable product. Upcycling involves turning an unwanted product into a
				better-quality product. The big idea is that items made from recycled
				materials can be even more desirable than the original products, which can
				only be a good thing for sustainable production with environmental
				consciousness.</p>

				<h2>Collector's items</h2>
				<p>In this fast-fashion industry, the fascination for collector’s items
				like antique and vintage items has exploded. These pieces has a history
				attached to it, rare in design and is often hard to reproduce, which is
				contrary to the current trend where nearly everything is mass produced and
				distributed to almost every country. Read more about some of the stores
				that sell rare items in Bergen.</p>
