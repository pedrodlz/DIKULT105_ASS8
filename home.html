					<h2>What is upcycling?</h2>
					<p> Upcycling is the practice of creating a useable product from waste or unwanted items. In addition to transforming old materials into useable objects, you can breathe a new lease of life into well used and loved items to give them a new story and personality. All this while at the same time creating something that is useful, functional and beautiful.</p>

					<h2>Recycle vs. upcycle?</h2>
					<p>Recycling is the process of taking waste, generally consumer materials – plastic, paper, metal or glass – breaking it down and turning it into a reusable product. Upcycling involves turning an unwanted product into a better-quality product. The big idea is that items made from recycled materials can be even more desirable than the original products, which can only be a good thing for sustainable production with environmental consciousness.</p>
